## Abstract

Colour Refinement is an iterative algorithm for graphs that computes a colouring
of the vertices, based on the colouring of their direct neighbours. Aside from useful
applications in various fields, it is theoretically interesting, due to its characterisations.
It was proved that the distinguishing power of Colour Refinement is equivalent to
that of counting logic with two variables and to that of counting homomorphisms
from trees. Therefore, the question, whether such an algorithm is also possible for
extensions of graphs was posed. Recently, Scheidt and Schweikardt defined a Colour
Refinement algorithm for relational structures with analogous characterisations. Its
distinguishing power is equivalent to that of the guarded fragment of counting logic
and to that of counting homomorphisms from Î±-acyclic relational structures.

In this thesis, we want to present the results of Scheidt and Schweikardt and inves-
tigate the robustness of their algorithm and characterisations. Concretely, we consider
two possible extensions of the algorithm. One to all structures and one to structures
with relations and unary functions. We find a logical characterisation for both ap-
proaches, but disprove the existence of a characterisation through homomorphism
counting. Furthermore, we discuss for which restrictions on relational structures the
characterisation through homomorphism counting remains and present results for two
different restrictions.
